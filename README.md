# seven_segment
To multiplex 7 GPIOs, so that two/more seven segments displays can be used with 7 GPIO pins alone.

The Source code is written in oreder to operate two seven segment(Common Cathode type) diplays with 7 GPIO pins. Inorder to use seven segment(Common Anode type) the polarity in all the commands should be changed.

The entire code is written in Arduino IDE, but no inbuilt functions of Arduino is used i.e. Embedded-C commands are used.
